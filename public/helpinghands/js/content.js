   Nilu's Helping Hands — curriculum content
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   ALL child-facing language lives in this file so it can be reviewed
   line-by-line by a clinical reviewer (RBT / Clinical Supervisor)
   before launch. Language rules used throughout:
     • short literal sentences, present tense, no idioms or sarcasm
     • the child is never blamed; telling is always praised
     • abuse is never depicted — only the situation's edge + feeling
     • "keep telling" is practiced, not just mentioned
   Frameworks drawn from: protective-behaviors education (Helping Hand /
   five trusted adults), NSPCC PANTS, Second Step child-protection unit,
   Kidpower (No–Go–Tell), Daniel Morcombe (Recognise–React–Report).
   Tier B scenarios are marked reviewPending: true and show a
   "Clinical review" ribbon in-game.
